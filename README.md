# 🍷 K-Means Clustering Implementation

This project explores unsupervised learning by applying **K-Means Clustering** and **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** to the **Red Wine Quality dataset**. The aim is to segment wines into distinct groups based on their physicochemical properties and visualize them in reduced dimensions.

## 📌 Objective

To group red wines into meaningful clusters using **K-Means**, and apply **PCA** for visualizing high-dimensional chemical data in 2D space.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

### 🔹 K-Means Clustering
K-Means is an unsupervised learning algorithm that partitions the data into **K clusters** based on feature similarity.

### 🔹 PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
PCA reduces high-dimensional data to fewer dimensions (usually 2 or 3) while retaining the most important variance, useful for visualization and preprocessing.
